Eddy, I told you not to tell people about My goofy ahh HyperTabs, so no more HyperTabs for you. <br/> <br/>

I don't want cyclic (the dynamic website hoster that I am using to host HyperTabs) blocked you getting caught using it.

I will be changing the subdomain of my HyperTabs fork deploy soon. I don't really care for this but I wish to for every once in a while have a little more freedom with my school iPad.

This sucks ass anyways.
